  <h1><strong>Tristan's blog</strong></h1>
  <p>August 10, 2018</p>
  <p>I really don't want to write this stupid blog anymore. Its been one of the worst weeks ever.</p>
  <p>There has been a lot of people talking about our old tradition coming back. There's even news agencies coming to our homes.</p>
  <p>They keep saying awful stuff and blowing stuff out of proportion. They make all of the people I grew up with look like the bad guys.</p>
  <p>Kids at school are starting to bother us about it. Kai came home crying the other day.
  <p>Kai loves whales, he says the kids in class said we want to kill them all.</p>
  <p>Dad says not tho listen to them. He says that our tribe has been Whalers for generations and that we have permission but people do not listen.</p>
<p>He worries that we won't be able to be who we are. That someday we will lose that part of our culture forever. I wish people could see that part too.</p>
