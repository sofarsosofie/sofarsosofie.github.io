	<p> Hey internet!</p>
	<p>Its finally the weekend! I had so many chores this week. Talk about unlucky.</p>
	<p>I'm just happy I didnt get sick. Kai came back with a cold friday night. He didnt get better until Tuesday so he had to stay home.</p>
	<p>He was so talkative when I got back from hanging out with my friends. Apparently some guys in suits came over to the house to talk to dad. Kai says they were talking about</p>
	<p>stopping the tradition again. I'm a little pissed to be honest. We aren't able to celebrate a lot of our traditions already and dad says there shouldn't be a problem.</p>
	<p>Its just super confusing.</p>
	<p>But we don't have to think about it right now. Cuz today is my 10th birthday and my friends are coming over. Mom and Dad got me a new bike this year. </p>
	<p> Kai made me a new drawing. My aunts and uncles came over yesterday and we had a pre-party before today. Honestly the more cake the better! I still can't</p>
	<p> believe that all of my family came over. Its going to be a fun weekend.</p>
