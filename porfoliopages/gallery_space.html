		<p>Class Project</p>
		<p>Objective: Create a gallery space to exhibit your Minecraft sculpture.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, my sculpture was meant to be interacted with. To be able to achieve this, I had to make it larger than life. It was intended to be its own gallery space. This is why the sculpture's surroundings are so simple. Anything more complicated than this would have taken away from the meaning I intended. My video is 1:06, much longer than I intended. However, this is the only way I was able to show all the detail of my piece.</p> 
<p>My sculpture started out as a way to cope from being away from my family during such an important celebration. I wanted to use easily recognizable parts of the holiday to guide the audience to the meaning of the celebration. It is essentially a day of remembrance for passed loved ones. I wanted to create a space where everyone can celebrate it.</p>
