	<h2 style="background-color:rgb(0,195,195);"><strong>I am so sorry:(</strong></h2>
	<p>I am really sorry but the celebration has been cancelled. We will not be able to go up to Washington this year.</p>
	<p> We are staying in the central coast instead.</p>
	<p> I really wish I could tell you more. When I asked my parents why we weren't going, they said that they will explain it when I'm older</p>
	<p> They must have been really worried about the trip. Even Mom looked scared. I'm sad that I won't be able to meet you all</p>
	<p> Maybe next year I will able to see you.</p>
	<p> Thank you for all of your support and I hope you have a wonderful year.</p>
