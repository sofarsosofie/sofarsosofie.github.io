  <h1><strong>Tristan's blog</strong></h1>
  <p>August 24, 2018</p>
  <p>Our fanily is having a huge celebration! I haven't seen everyone this excited for so long.</p>
  <p>But I can't help but feel a little sad. A whale got hit by a fishing boat yesterday. Kai cried when he found out. He loves whales a lot</p>
  <p>Our tribe gets to keep the whale though. My dad went to help cut up the whale for a feast. He says the whale is going to feed all of us for weeks too!</p>
  <p>He says he's content because we can celebrate our culture in this way. And its just in time for <a href="http://makah.com/activities/makah-days/" target="_blank">Makah Days</a> too.</p>
  <p>I'm happy that I can be a part of it too.</p>
  <p>I hope one day people will understand our way of life, because we want to celebrate every part of our culture.</p>
