  <h1> Tristan's Blog</h1>
	<p>June 28, 2018</p>
	<p> Hey internet,</p>
	<p>My name is Tristan and I'm from the Makah Tribe. I live in Neah Bay in Washington. I have a little brother named Kai.</p>
	<p> I'm nine years old but I'll be turning ten next month.</p>
	<p> This is the beginning of my blog for my summer homework. We're supposed to keep a journal of our everyday life.</p>
	<p> We get extra credit if we do more that just "write it down." </p>
	<p> Anyway, today has been hectic, more hectic than usual. Kai kept trying to run away while we were going to the park. I swear that kid is going to get me in so much trouble</p>
	<p>Dad keeps talking about the renewing of a tradition. Its been 70+ years</p>
	<p> since we were able to celebrate it. I guess I'm not sure how I feel about it yet. But I guess I have to know more about it...Will post updates.</p>
	<p> Before I forget, we are supossed to have an image after our entry.</p>
