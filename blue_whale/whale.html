<p> My name is Maeva and I am a <i>Eschrichtius robustus</i> or a Gray Whale for short.</p>
<p> I am four years old now. I have a Mom and a Dad who always look after me.</p>
<p> We travel with our pod so I guess there is a lot of us looking after each other.</p>
<p> Ever since I was born we have been around Mexico and California. But this year is different.</p> 
<p> We are migrating farther than we ever have in a very long time. A huge group of us are going to Washingtion and I</p>
<p> am super excited! Mom says its the prettiest place she has ever seen! That's why I want to celebrate with all of you!</p> 
<h2>Fun Facts About My Family</h2>
<p> My is about 15 meters long! Thats about 45 feet! I'm only 6 meters long but I hope one day to be as big as him</p>
<p>My mom is the toughest person I know! No one can mess with her! I want to be like her when I grow up.</p>
<p>We are Eastern Gray whales which means we are local to the west coast of Central and North America.</p>
<p>There used to be not many of us. Mom and Dad won't tell me why yet though. But there is so many more of us now!</p>
<p> We also love to sing! If you come to the celebration, maybe we will even sing for you guys!</p>
